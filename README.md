# COVID-19-Stats

This is basically a website showing the COVID 19 statistics. As we all are quite aware of the havoc prevailing the pandemic, I decided to create a website on the same. This was made not only to help the viewers but also help me learn more. 

I have made this website with the help of HTML and CSS for the designing while the backhand has been done completely with Javascript.  The website initially shows the total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total recovery and new recovery worldwide. Along with this, a line graph showing the daily cases and deaths worldwide has been provided to help the viewer know the curve of the same. If the viewer likes to see the data of any particular country, they can always change the country to find the data of the required. 

This was initially made to learn and explore more about JavaScript. Therefore, the design has completely been taken from a YouTube video. The app.js is done purely by me.
